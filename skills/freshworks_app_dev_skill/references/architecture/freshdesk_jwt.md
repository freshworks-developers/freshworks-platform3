# What is JWT support in freshworks apps

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON based way of securely transferring information between two parties. To make a request that uses JWT, we first generate a token and then use it to make the request. For this, we use two popular npm libraries: `jsonwebtoken` and `request`. You have to list them in the `manifest.json` file with the corresponding versions as shown.

## Include JWT dependencies in manifest.json

```json
{
"dependencies": {
    "jsonwebtoken": "8.1.1",
    "request": "2.72.0"
  }
}
```

# How to use JWT in freshworks apps

The JWT token consists of three parts - header, payload, and signature. The token (with the header, payload, signature) is generated by signing the payload with the secret or private key. It is then passed in the Authorization header of the request as shown in the sample code.

## Use JWT in your application

To use JWT in your application, include the below code snippet in your `server.js`

```js
// server.js
var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
var request = require('request');
function jwt_request(){
    // { foo: 'bar' } is the data and secret is the secret or private key
    var jwt_token = jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, 'secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });
    var options = {
      url: 'https://url.com',
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        'Authorization': jwt_token
      }
    };
    request(options, function(error, response, body){
        //logic to handle success or failure
    });
}
```
